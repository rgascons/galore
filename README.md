# Galore

I want to make a horde survival game with some roguelite elements. It'll be based on phaser, with a thing React layer on top.

## Current state and stuff I want to do
- [x] Add player character and a couple obstacles
- [x] Add sprites
- [x] One of the obstacles shoots an arrow towards the player, if arrow touches the player the game resets
- [x] Arrow follows the player
- [ ] One of the obstacles spawns a mob, which shoots an arrow towards the player
- [ ] Bigger map, figure out how to place assets down via config file idk
- [ ] The list will go on as I learn more Phaser
