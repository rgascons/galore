# Galore

I want to make a horde survival game with some roguelite elements. It'll be based on phaser, with a thin React layer on top.

## How to run
Install dependencies via `npm i` and then run `npm run dev`

## Current state and stuff I want to do
- [x] Add player character and a couple obstacles
- [x] Add sprites
- [x] One of the obstacles shoots an arrow towards the player, if arrow touches the player the game resets
- [x] Arrow follows the player
- [x] One of the obstacles spawns a mob, which shoots an arrow towards the player
- [X] If the player touches the mob, the mob dies
- [X] The player can shoot bullets to the closest monster by pressing space bar
- [X] Monsters spawn randomly in the arena
- [X] Walls stop bullets and monsters
- [ ] Bigger map, figure out how to place assets down via config file idk
- [ ] The list will go on as I learn more Phaser
